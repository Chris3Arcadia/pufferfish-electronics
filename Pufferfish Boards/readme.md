# Pufferfish Boards

This folder contains the [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/) design files for the Pufferfish ventilator.

To review the hardware files, start by opening the project file `Pufferfish.pro` with KiCad. From there, schematics, boards, and library parts can be viewed.

`Pufferfish.sch` and `Pufferfish.kicad_pcb` are dummy files, kept to aid in managing project resources (eg. footprint and schematic library settings).

The files `sym-lib-table` and `fp-lib-table` define the paths for local part libraries. These should point to `/library/symbols/` and `/library/footprints/` for symbols and footprints, respectively.

The file `Pufferfish.kicad_wks` contains the template schematic page layout for this project.
