These are directories containg the custom part libraries for Pez Globo's Pufferfish Ventilator. Add them to your KiCad environment's global paths for schematics, footprints, etc.

Some components, their symbols and footprints, have been adapted from third party designs (outside of KiCAD and PezGlobo). Specifically, several component CAD Models were provided by SamacSys ([www.ComponentSearchEngine.com](http://www.componentsearchengine.com/)) with permission from Paul Woolford (Director of Applications) on July 2, 2020.
